This assignment expores two methods for estimating the MNL model: (1) via Maximum Likelihood, and (2) via a Bayesian approach using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. 


## 1. Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$



## 2. Simulate Conjoint Data

We will simulate data from a conjoint experiment about video content streaming services. We elect to simulate 100 respondents, each completing 10 choice tasks, where they choose from three alternatives per task. For simplicity, there is not a "no choice" option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives. 

Each alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from \$4 to \$32 in increments of \$4.

The part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer $i$ for hypothethical streaming service $j$ is 

$$
u_{ij} = (1 \times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\times Price_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where the variables are binary indicators and $\varepsilon$ is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.

The following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.
:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Define attributes
brand = ["N", "P", "H"]  # Netflix, Prime, Hulu
ad = ["Yes", "No"]
price = np.arange(8, 33, 4)  # $8 to $32 in $4 increments

# Generate all possible profiles
profiles = pd.DataFrame([
    {'brand': b, 'ad': a, 'price': p}
    for b in brand for a in ad for p in price
])
m = profiles.shape[0]

# Part-worth utilities (true parameters)
b_util = {"N": 1.0, "P": 0.5, "H": 0}
a_util = {"Yes": -0.8, "No": 0.0}
p_util = lambda p: -0.1 * p

# Configuration
n_peeps = 100
n_tasks = 10
n_alts = 3

# Function to simulate one respondentâ€™s data
def sim_one(id_):
    all_tasks = []
    for t in range(1, n_tasks + 1):
        sampled = profiles.sample(n=n_alts).copy()
        sampled["resp"] = id_
        sampled["task"] = t
        sampled["v"] = (
            sampled["brand"].map(b_util) +
            sampled["ad"].map(a_util) +
            p_util(sampled["price"])
        )
        # Add Gumbel (Type I Extreme Value) noise
        gumbel_noise = -np.log(-np.log(np.random.uniform(size=n_alts)))
        sampled["u"] = sampled["v"] + gumbel_noise
        sampled["choice"] = (sampled["u"] == sampled["u"].max()).astype(int)
        all_tasks.append(sampled)

    return pd.concat(all_tasks)

# Simulate data for all respondents
conjoint_data = pd.concat([sim_one(i) for i in range(1, n_peeps + 1)])

# Keep only observable variables
conjoint_data = conjoint_data[["resp", "task", "brand", "ad", "price", "choice"]]

conjoint_data.head()

```

## 3. Preparing the Data for Estimation

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.  In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.

```{python}
# Step 1: Encode categorical variables
conjoint_data['brand_N'] = (conjoint_data['brand'] == 'N').astype(int)
conjoint_data['brand_P'] = (conjoint_data['brand'] == 'P').astype(int)
conjoint_data['ad_Yes'] = (conjoint_data['ad'] == 'Yes').astype(int)

# Step 2: Combine encoded categorical variables with numeric variables
conjoint_data['price_scaled'] = conjoint_data['price']  # Keep price as numeric
X = conjoint_data[['brand_N', 'brand_P', 'ad_Yes', 'price_scaled']].values

# Step 3: Store structured data for estimation
y = conjoint_data['choice'].values
n, k = X.shape  # n = number of rows, k = number of covariates

# Step 4: Check dimensions
print(f"Number of observations (n): {n}")
print(f"Number of covariates (k): {k}")

# Step 5: Preview reshaped X as a DataFrame
X_df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['brand_N', 'brand_P', 'ad_Yes', 'price_scaled'])
print(X_df.head())
```

## 4. Estimation via Maximum Likelihood
```{python}
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the MNL log-likelihood function
def mnl_log_likelihood(beta, X, y):
    """
    Multinomial Logit Log-Likelihood Function
    :param beta: Coefficients (array-like)
    :param X: Covariates (n x k matrix)
    :param y: Choices (binary vector of length n)
    :return: Negative log-likelihood (to minimize)
    """
    utilities = X @ beta  # Linear combination of covariates and coefficients
    exp_utilities = np.exp(utilities)  # Exponentiate utilities
    probabilities = exp_utilities / exp_utilities.sum(axis=0)  # Normalize probabilities
    log_probabilities = np.log(probabilities)
    log_likelihood = np.sum(y * log_probabilities)  # Log-likelihood
    return -log_likelihood  # Negative log-likelihood for minimization

# Initial guesses for beta coefficients
initial_beta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])

# Set up and run the optimizer
result = minimize(
    fun=mnl_log_likelihood,
    x0=initial_beta,
    args=(X, y),
    method='BFGS'
)

# Extract results
estimated_beta = result.x
log_likelihood_at_optimum = -result.fun

# Label the estimated coefficients
parameters = ['beta_netflix', 'beta_prime', 'beta_ads', 'beta_price']
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'Parameter': parameters,
    'Estimate': estimated_beta
})

# Print results
print(results)
print(f"Log-Likelihood at Optimum: {log_likelihood_at_optimum}")

```


```{python}
# Calculate standard errors and confidence intervals
hessian_inv = result.hess_inv  # Inverse Hessian matrix
standard_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))  # Standard errors from diagonal of Hessian

# Construct 95% confidence intervals
confidence_intervals = [
    (est - 1.96 * se, est + 1.96 * se)
    for est, se in zip(estimated_beta, standard_errors)
]

# Combine results into a DataFrame
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'Parameter': parameters,
    'Estimate': estimated_beta,
    'Std. Error': standard_errors,
    '95% CI Lower': [ci[0] for ci in confidence_intervals],
    '95% CI Upper': [ci[1] for ci in confidence_intervals]
})

# Print results
print(results)
```

The output provides a detailed summary of the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for four parameters in the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, along with their standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. These estimates quantify how different attributes (streaming service brand, ad presence, and price) influence the probability of a product being chosen.

1. beta_netflix: Holding other factors constant, choosing Netflix increases the utility of a product by approximately 0.59 units relative to the baseline brand (likely Hulu). The 95% confidence interval [0.434, 0.745] does not include 0, indicating the effect is statistically significant. The standard error (0.079) is relatively small, suggesting the estimate is precise. This reflects a strong preference for Netflix.

2. beta_prime: Choosing Amazon Prime increases utility by 0.31 units, again relative to the baseline. The 95% confidence interval [0.145, 0.475] excludes 0, indicating statistical significance. The standard error (0.084) is a bit higher than for Netflix but still moderate, suggesting the estimate is fairly precise. Prime is also preferred over the baseline, though less strongly than Netflix.

3. beta_ads: The presence of ads reduces the utility of a product by âˆ’0.43 units. The confidence interval [âˆ’0.558, âˆ’0.304] lies entirely below 0, indicating a statistically significant negative effect. The standard error (0.065) is small, confirming this is a robust and meaningful finding: ads detract from the productâ€™s attractiveness.

4. beta_price: Each unit increase in price reduces utility by about âˆ’0.058 units. While this is the smallest effect in magnitude, the confidence interval [âˆ’0.066, âˆ’0.049] is extremely narrow and does not contain 0, indicating a very precise and statistically significant effect. This aligns with economic intuition: higher prices reduce utility.

Overall, all four parameters are statistically significant, and the signs of the coefficients align with expected consumer preferences: consumers prefer Netflix and Prime over the baseline, dislike ads, and are sensitive to price increases.

## 5. Estimation via Bayesian Methods

_todo: code up a metropolis-hasting MCMC sampler of the posterior distribution. Take 11,000 steps and throw away the first 1,000, retaining the subsequent 10,000._

_hint: Use N(0,5) priors for the betas on the binary variables, and a N(0,1) prior for the price beta._

_hint: instead of calculating post=lik*prior, you can work in the log-space and calculate log-post = log-lik + log-prior (this should enable you to re-use your log-likelihood function from the MLE section just above)_

_hint: King Markov (in the video) use a candidate distribution of a coin flip to decide whether to move left or right among his islands.  Unlike King Markov, we have 4 dimensions (because we have 4 betas) and our dimensions are continuous.  So, use a multivariate normal distribution to pospose the next location for the algorithm to move to. I recommend a MNV(mu, Sigma) where mu=c(0,0,0,0) and sigma has diagonal values c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005) and zeros on the off-diagonal.  Since this MVN has no covariances, you can sample each dimension independently (so 4 univariate normals instead of 1 multivariate normal), where the first 3 univariate normals are N(0,0.05) and the last one if N(0,0.005)._


_todo: for at least one of the 4 parameters, show the trace plot of the algorithm, as well as the histogram of the posterior distribution._

_todo: report the 4 posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals and compare them to your results from the Maximum Likelihood approach._



## 6. Discussion

_todo: Suppose you did not simulate the data. What do you observe about the parameter estimates? What does $\beta_\text{Netflix} > \beta_\text{Prime}$ mean? Does it make sense that $\beta_\text{price}$ is negative?_

_todo: At a high level, discuss what change you would need to make in order to simulate data from --- and estimate the parameters of --- a multi-level (aka random-parameter or hierarchical) model. This is the model we use to analyze "real world" conjoint data._
